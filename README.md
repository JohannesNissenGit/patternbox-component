This is a simple project to implement the challenge proposed by you :)

Since there was no Icon component (now renamed to SimpleIcon) provided. So i reimagined it as a simple dynamic 
component, which receives name and size as props and renders an image based on them.

The underlying scaffolding is based on Quasar v2 with Vite.

Enjoy!
